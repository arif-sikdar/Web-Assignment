            with the material actively, promoting deeper learning and

            students to analyze information, evaluate different perspectives,
            and make informed decisions based on evidence, helping them develop
            their critical thinking skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provides feedback: Assignments provide an opportunity for students
            to receive feedback from their instructors, which can help them
            identify areas of strength and weakness and improve their
            performance.

          <li>
            Promotes independent learning: Assignments require students to work
